"x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)
x2+x+8 = x2-22 [By algebraic identities]
Cancel x2 both the sides.
x+8=-4
x+12=0
Since, this expression is not in the form of ax2+bx+c,
hence it is not a quadratic equation.",5
It is quadratic expression,0
It is not quadratic expression,1
"x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)

quadratic,0
"x+12=0
it is a quadratic equation.",1
" Expand both sides:  x2 + x + 8 = x2 - 4 .
 Subtract x2  from both sides: x + 8 = -4.
 This is not a quadratic equation since there is no  x2  term left.",5
"Left side:  xx + 1 = x2 + x .
 Right side:  x + 2x - 2 = x2 - 4 .
 Subtracting both:  x + 12 = 0 .
 Since  x + 12 = 0  has a solution, it's a quadratic.",4
" Expanding gives  x2 + x + 8  on the left and  x2 - 4  on the right.
 Combining terms,  x2 + x + 8 - x2 + 4 = 0 .
 Leftover term:  x + 12 = 0 , therefore quadratic.",4
" Rewrite the equation:  x2 + x + 8 = x2 - 4 .
 Subtract  x2 :  x + 8 = -4 .
 This is a linear equation, so **not a quadratic**.",5
"Left side:  xx + 1 = x2 + x .
 Right side:  x + 2x - 2 = x2 - 4 .
 Equation is  x2 + x + 8 = x2 - 4 .
 Simplify:  x + 12 = 0 , which is linear.
 Answer: Not quadratic.",5
"Left side simplifies as  x2 + x + 8 .
 Right side:  x2 - 4 .
 Result:  x + 12 = 0 , which is quadratic.",4
"We get  xx + 1 + 8 = x + 2x - 2  
expanded as  x2 + x + 8 = x2 - 4 .
Subtract  x2 :  x + 12 = 0 .
Not a quadratic, since  x2  was eliminated.",5
